    "# Teaching a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to draw MNIST characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders are a type of neural network that can be used to learn efficient codings of input data. \n",
    "Given some inputs, the network firstly applies a series of transformations that map the input data into a lower dimensional space. This part of the network is called the _encoder_. Then, the network uses the encoded data to try and recreate the inputs. This part of the network is the _decoder_. Using the encoder, we can later compress data of the type that is understood by the network. However, autoencoders are rarely used for this purpose, as usually there exist hand-crafted algorithms (like _jpg_-compression) that are more efficient. Instead, autoencoders have repeatedly been applied to perform denoising tasks. Then, the encoder receives pictures that have been tampered with noise, and it learns how to reconstruct the original images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variational Autoencoders put simply\n",
    "But there exists a much more interesting application for autoencoders. This application is called the _variational autoencoder_. Using variational autoencoders, it's not only possible to compress data -- it's also possible to generate new objects of the type the autoencoder has seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a general autoencoder, we don't know anything about the coding that's been generated by our network. We could take a look at and compare different encoded objects, but it's unlikely that we'll be able to understand what's going on. This means that we won't be able to use our decoder for creating new objects -- we simply don't know what the inputs should look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a variational autoencoder, we take the opposite approach instead. We will not try to make guesses concerning the distribution that's being followed by the latent vectors. We simply tell our network what we want this distribution to look like. Usually, we will constrain the network to produce latent vectors having entries that follow the unit normal distribution. Then, when trying to generate data, we can simply sample some values from this distribution, feed them to the decoder, and the decoder will return us completely new objects that appear just like the objects our network has been trained with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this can be done using python and tensorflow. We are going to teach our network how to draw MNIST characters."

During training, it will have a value of 0.8. When generating new data, we won't apply dropout, so the value will be 1.
