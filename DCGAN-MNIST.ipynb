    "# Teaching a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to draw MNIST characters\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last tutorial, we learnt using tensorflow for designing a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that could draw MNIST characters. Most of the created digits looked nice. There was only one drawback -- some of the created images looked a bit fuzzy. The VAE was trained with the _mean squared error_ loss function. However, it's quite difficult to encode exact character edge locations, which leads to the network being unsure about those edges. And does it really matter if the edge of a character starts a few pixels more to the left or right? Not really.\n",
    "In this article, we will see how we can train a network that does not depend on the mean squared error or any related loss functions--instead, it will learn all by itself what a real image should look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks\n",
    "Another network architecture for learning to generate new content is the DCGAN. Like the VAE, our DCGAN consists of two parts:\n",
    "* The _discriminator_ learns how to distinguish fake from real objects of the type we'd like to create\n",
    "* The _generator_ creates new content and tries to fool the discriminator\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a HackerNoon article by Chanchana Sornsoontorn that explains the concept in more detail and describes some creative projects DCGANs have been applied to. One of these projects is the generation of MNIST characters. Let's try to use python and tensorflow for the same purpose."

The number of these inputs is being set to 100. Batch normalization considerably improved the training of this network. For tensorflow to apply batch normalization, we need to let it know whether we are in training mode. The variable _keep_prob_ will be used by our dropout layers, which we introduce for more stable learning outcomes.\n",

Also, I firstly had a much larger dense layer accepting the generator input. This led to the generator creating the same output always, no matter what the input noise was. Tuning the generator honestly took quite some effort!"
